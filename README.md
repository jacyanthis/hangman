# hangman

This is a simple Hangman game from the App Academy prepwork curriculum (completed before the course). My partner for this assignment was Irene Foelschow. To try it out, please run `ruby hangman.rb`.

Includes:

- User interface to choose player types (humans or computers)

- Dictionary file

- Self-improving AI (keeps track of words given by humans and weights them more heavily when guessing letters)
